// map and forEach are both array iteration methods in JavaScript, but they have subtle differences in terms of behavior and performance. Let's compare their performance implications and discuss scenarios where one might be preferred over the other.

// Performance Implications:
// Return Value:

// map returns a new array containing the results of applying a provided function to each element of the original array.
// forEach returns undefined and is primarily used for side effects (e.g., modifying an external variable or logging).
// Use of Result:

// If you need a transformed array based on the original one, map is generally more appropriate.
// If you want to perform an action for each element without creating a new array, forEach is suitable.
// Chaining:

// map is chainable, allowing you to chain multiple operations together.
// forEach cannot be easily chained, as it always returns undefined.
// Performance Considerations:
// Performance Impact:

// map involves creating a new array and populating it with the results of the provided function, resulting in a new array.
// forEach simply iterates over the array and applies the provided function to each element without creating a new array.
// Memory Usage:

// map might use more memory because it creates a new array.
// forEach has a smaller memory footprint since it doesn't create a new array.
// Mutability vs. Immutability:

// If immutability is a concern, using map to create a new array with transformed values is more appropriate.
// If you are working with mutable data and only need side effects, forEach might be more efficient.
// Scenarios:
// When to Use map:

// When you want to transform each element of an array and create a new array with the results.
// When you need to chain multiple array operations.
// When immutability is a priority.
// When to Use forEach:

// When you need to perform side effects (e.g., logging, modifying external variables) for each element.
// When you don't need a new array with transformed values.

// Using map
const originalArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const squaredArray = originalArray.map(num => num * num);

console.log("Original Array:", originalArray);
console.log("Squared Array:", squaredArray);

// Using forEach
originalArray.forEach((num, index) => {
    originalArray[index] = num * num;
});

console.log("Original Array (modified using forEach):", originalArray);
// In this example, map is used to create a new array with squared values, while forEach is used to modify the original array in place.

// Summary:
// Use map when you want to transform elements and create a new array.
// Use forEach when you want to perform side effects or modify elements in the existing array without creating a new one.
// Ultimately, the choice between map and forEach depends on the specific requirements of your task and whether you need to create a new array or modify the existing one.
